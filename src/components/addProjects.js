            notes: 'This is a simple recipe application built with React and SASS.

The game sets a sequence that the user must follow, as the game progresses the sequence becomes harder and harder. Unless the user fails within 13 rounds, he/ she wins. I chose to write it using Vanilla JavaScript specifically  to avoid using an external library like jQuery and made use of the Module Design Pattern to structure the application.',

The application allows the user to set a time period for a work sesion and the same for a break session, the app will then run until the user stops it. Once again I used Vanilla JavaScript to build in the functionality.

The algorithm allows the computer to see all possible configurations of the the future state of the game, each configuration returns a score and the computer plays the next move according to the highest score.
